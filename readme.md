SASS

Component Styles are pulled from their component directory manually after the styles.scss file. Anything added to /assets/scss/ must be added to styles.scss manually. The idea here is that these styles will mostly be global in nature and are relied upon by other Sass files. Examples include button styles, color variables, etc.
